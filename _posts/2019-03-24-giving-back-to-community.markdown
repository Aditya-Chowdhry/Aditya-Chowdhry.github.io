This is for students/professionals who are looking to make a career in programming/computer-science/software-development and have questions like - 

- How to start?
- What fields can I get into? 
- What things should I do to get into xyz? 
- Am I on right track? 
- How to prepare for interviews?  

..etc Or any other questions.

## Why I am doing this?
In India, lakhs of engineers graduate everyear and only a handful of engineers secure a good engineering job. <https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/only-6-of-those-passing-out-of-indias-engineering-colleges-are-fit-for-a-job/articleshow/64446292.cms>

I can't change the above completely but I want to focus on those who are genuinely interested in making a career in this field but lack good mentorship and connect with the current industry. 

In my initial years of college, one thing that I had trouble with was getting good guidance. I didn't even know in what direction should I prepare myself. With a lot of trial and error, I met with some really good people and discovered a lot of different things. This helped me to set a target and prepare for it. And this is a very common state among students in India.

There are many reasons for this state - outdated curriculum, lack of good teachers, mindset, unauthorized colleges etc. It's hard to change all of this. But one can start small, so this is my attempt to guide/mentor the willing ones in the right direction.  

IMO, Good guidance at the right time can do wonders. Getting guidance shouldn't be hard.
