## March
Contribution to an Open source project [collectiveidea/unicode_math](https://github.com/collectiveidea/unicode_math)

Fun Ruby extensions for doing math with Unicode

**Usage**

**Fractions**

You can use many fractions as literals:
{% highlight js %}
⅞ * 530 + ½⅖ / ⅙
{% endhighlight %}  
sdasd

**Roots**

You can use square root, cube root, and fourth root:
{% highlight js %}
√ 4∛ 27∜ 81
{% endhighlight %}

**Trigonometry**

There's a sine wave unicode character, so we can calculate sine of a number:
{% highlight js %}
∿ π/2
{% endhighlight %}

**Constants**

Easily use unicode:costants
{% highlight js %}
πτ∞
{% endhighlight %}

And have fun with them:

{% highlight js %}
(-∞..∞).cover? ∞ + 1
{% endhighlight %}

And many more!

## April
SafeHouse - [SafeHouse-Github](https://github.com/shubh3794/SafeHouse)

Developed an application "SafeHouse" for Disaster Management in a 24-hour hackathon.

**Project description:**

In the light of recent events in Nepal, Paris, Maharashtra, Pakistan etc it became clear we lack proper disaster management system.

Had it been otherwise, a lot of lives could have been saved. With this project we aim to provide the required knowledge and the means to the victims and organisations like NGO's at the time of peril.

User reports a disaster Based on reported disaster's location and type, push notification will be given to all the users near that area. Depending on how manyusers were notified and how many were in trouble, we prioritize the disaster by Geometric mean. All the information is being communicated in real time, As soon as disaster is reported. An unauthorized, unauthenticated user can easily get help because we know data plans are expensive and everyone does not have a smart phone, so just send an SMS at 09243422233 with your place name only eg. Delhi.

Distance based show of results on map with call option on your phone. No downloads, no browsing required.
